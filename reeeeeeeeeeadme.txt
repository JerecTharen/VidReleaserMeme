REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Fine, you want a readme you'll get a readme. Grab you're crack pipe, you'll need it loser.

--Overview--
Was heading to bed one night after binging a ton of Michael Reeves videos and was thinking about how I wasn't
able to ruin the comment section with bad robot ideas (because I don't have any). Then it hit me like a YouTube
buddy fired out of a confetti canon - I had plenty of bad programming ideas.

However, I realized that it was just too easy to ignore a YouTube comment. No way were my bad ideas going to end
up in the idea shredder. You know what's not easy to ignore? A pull request. If a pull request is submitted
against some doo-doo repository he'll get GitHub notifications!

And so vid-reeeeeeeeeeeeelease was born.

--Objective--
It's well known that the video release schedule is more random than quantum mechanics or radioactive decay,
but what if the release schedule and video content were made from radioactive decay? Well, that's the objective.

1. Find random number generation on internet based off of quantum mechanics or radioactive decay.
    Done, courtesy of Hotbits I can get a hexidecimal string to seed my random number generation.
    Request an API key from them and put it into apikey.txt to get true radioactive decay. Without
    a key, the seed is just an algorithm that uses the radioactive decay to help a little.

2. Create framework to use that randum number generation to decide when next to release a video.

3. Interact with YouTube API to upload said video and release it on the previously generated due date.

4. Use randum number generation to create the video.

It's over now. Go home. You don't want to read through any more nerd s***
