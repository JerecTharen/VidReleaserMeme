REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Fine, you want a readme you'll get a readme. Grab you're crack pipe, you'll need it loser.

--Overview--
Was heading to bed one night after binging a ton of Michael Reeves videos and was thinking about how I wasn't
able to ruin the comment section with bad robot ideas (because I don't have any). Then it hit me like a YouTube
buddy fired out of a confetti canon - I had plenty of bad programming ideas.

However, I realized that it was just too easy to ignore a YouTube comment. No way was my bad ideas going to end
up in the idea shredder. You know what's not easy to ignore? A pull request. If a pull request is submitted
against some doo-doo repository he'll get GitHub notifications!

And so vid-reeeeeeeeeeeeelease was born.

--Objective--
It's well known that the video release schedule is more random than quantum mechanics or radio active decay, 
but what if the release schedule and video content were made from quantum mechanics? Well, that's the objective.

1. Find random number generation on internet based off of quantum mechanics or radio active decay.

2. Create framework to use that randum number generation to decide when next to release a video.

3. Use randum number generation to create the video.

4. Interact with YouTube API to upload said video and release it on the previously generated due date.



It's over now. Go home. You don't want to read through any more nerd s***
